# MarqueeMaker - Final App

This is my final app, developed over three weeks.

Marquee signs are everywhere. They are the number one marketing tool any small business has. It communicates with potential customer at the absolute best possible time, when they're right in front of a store. They are also under-appreciated and under-utilized. Why? Those tiny letters are a pain! Finding the letters you need can take forever, especially when they are kept jumbled together in a box. Then you have to get the message up on the board. Changing a sign message can take up so much time that many businesses don't bother. The Marquee Maker app allows users to create custom messages and buy letters for their marquee sign.
