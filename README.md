# MarqueeMaker - Final App

This is my final app, developed over three weeks.

Marquee (readerboard) signs are everywhere. They are the number one marketing tool 
any business has. It communicates with potential customer at the absolute best possible time, 
when they're right in front of a store. They are also underappreciated and under-utilized.
Why? Those tiny letters are a pain! Finding the letters you need can take forever, especially when 
they are kept jumbled together in a box. Then you have to get the message up on the board.
Changing a sign message can take up so much time that many businesses don't bother. 

The app allows users to create and customize a message for their marquee sign.

**Features Include:**  
Sign in via Twitter  
Choose letter size  
Choose letter style  
Customize the placement of your message  
Save and share multiple boards  
Purchase letters
